History:

This directory contains merely some data files, programs, text files and screenshots
which are used, or made in time.

For fun, you can check ou the 'screenshots' folder in order to 'follow' the project and
actually see the results. I had a lot more screenshots actually, but due the size i had
to cut down the amount of bmp's.


screenshots are saved in a directory, the directory name is the date it was taken.
