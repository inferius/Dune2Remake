Structure bitmaps:

I believe that Dune 2 does not draw structures like normal bitmaps. In fact in Dune 2
i think every cell/square has a sort of bitmap/picture info. Because Dune 2 uses one
file with a lot of tiles, i assume they refer to that file/picture id. The structures
are probably 'assembled' by a few tiles. So when you place something, Dune 2 does
nothing but change the tile id on those cells and probably adds some class/struct ref-
erence somewhere in code so you can control the 'cells'. 

What i did is something different. I simply assembled the structures myself (which took
some time, i know) and i created 'frames'. All structures are 8 bit and using the
harkonnen/standard palette. This means the 'house color' drawing will be ok and i simply
have to give a 'frame' number in order to change the animation. 

When a building recieves damage due rockets or other heavy impact then you simply add a
'smoke' animation. Like on units; with a timer.
